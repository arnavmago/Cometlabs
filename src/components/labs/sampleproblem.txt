COMET is having various tasks in the list today. The list is so big he's afraid he might forget. COMET asks you to create a TODO React app. 
Requirements
1. A Textfield where he can write his todo and a button which can help him put todo in the list stack.
2. A list of todos that are already created
3. Each todo list item should contain 
	a. TODO_TEXT - the text that user entered.
	b. TODO_ID - a unique todo id for each todo.
	c. EDIT - a button to edit the todo.
	d. DELETE - a button to delete the todo.
4. On clicking EDIT, a modal should appear that contains
	a. textfield - the updated_text can be entered.
	b. UPDATE - a button enabled when update_todo entered and should update that todo.

Directions to Problem:
You only need two components
1. App - parent div component with className="App", should serve the purpose of listing todos and add todo
2. Todo - handles UI of each todo list item and update todo.

You should follow the naming conventions like if the component is ADD_TODO, give class as "add__todo"

Initials:
1. The file structure is already given to you with initial template needed.
2. We have also provided firebase.js file, which you can use if seems required.

Points and Judging:
	1. To run the app, We have provided the Run button, at the very bottom-right corner. The Run button, will check the test cases already written for the app.
	2. You may need to change/update the app, according to test status.
	3. To actually gain the points, you need to pass each test cases.
	4. Your points will also depends on time you took to solve the problem. Watch Clock.
	5. Points will also depends on how efficient your code is, depends on its loading time and browser load while running app.




Note: We may not need to give access to create files
